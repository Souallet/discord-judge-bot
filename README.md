# Judge Bot

JudgeBot is a small discord bot that allows you to run administration commands if a majority of users agree.

## How does it work ?

To use this bot, a user must write a command which will be accompanied by the target user as well as the reason associated with this action. Following the request to execute a command, a vote is launched for a limited period. The majority of voters must approve the action for it to be carried out.

## Commands

The Discord Bot uses the `judge-` prefix for any commands by default; if you change your prefix remember to set an env var `DISCORD_BOT_PREFIX` with your custom prefix.
